TSEC Hackathon project

## About the project
This project aims at providing an innovative approach to run NGOs. Our team Zero-Day provides an unique solution to this problem statement by providing a graphical analysis report for the administration. We keep a track of all the logistics and provide the admin an easier way of visualising the numbers. This allows the admin to make better decisions, handle resources-in-hand in the best possible way, allocate funds accordingly, and manage the intricate details easily and help the organisation expand.

## User Experience
We at Zero-Day believe that visual satisfaction is our primary concern, and thus we provide our users with a smooth experience. This project is a non-profit web app, our aim is to connect the underprivileged ones to the world and be the bridge for the donors to inspect and support our children to help them grow and be successful
